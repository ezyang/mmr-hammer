MMR Hammer

It is a truth universally acknowledged that multimaster replication
is a pain in the ass.  I mean, there's even a really sketchy Perl
script for setting up replication agreements that doesn't even do
it properly.  And when things break... hoo boy.

This is a script for Fedora DS 389; it might work for LDAP
implementations but is not tested.  Right now, it lets you print
your pristine replication agreements and bindings and temporarily
suspend them.  Useful if your server is getting wedged due to
replication.  Eventually it will support MMR initialization.  Oh,
and it's written in Haskell.

Multimaster replication not working for you?  It's HAMMERTIME.
